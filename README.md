Assignment: Classwork with MongoDB <br>
Description: In this classwork, we add on to the classwork with Node and Express in which we made the first version of our Confetti Cuisine recipe website. We connect the web app to a database. The end goal is to have the ability to save each subscriber's name, email address, and zip code to the database. <br>
No link for this one, because GitHub pages can only host static HTML pages, like the ones in prior assignments. No server side technology is supported, so Node.js applications won't run on GitHub pages. <br>
